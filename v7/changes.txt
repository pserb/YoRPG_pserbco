Most importantly changed monster selection:

Added a random number generator to randomly assign monsters to different sub classes each turn. No idea if this implementation works when protag lasts more than one round because monsters extremely powerful.

Also:
No longer displays negative health

Tweaked the stats of the entities, so protagonist has a chance to win:
Monsters generally have more health but do less damage and have less defense. 
Protagonists generally have higher more stable damage ranges but low attack ratings.
